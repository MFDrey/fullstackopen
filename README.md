## About <a name = "about"></a>

I came across this course while looking for good courses that come at no cost. It's offered by the University of Helsinki. 

A brief excerpt from the course's about page:

"This course serves as an introduction to modern web application development with JavaScript. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js. The course also contains a section on GraphQL, a modern alternative to REST APIs.
The course covers testing, configuration and environment management, the use of databases for storing the application‚Äôs data amongst other things.
The course is totally free of charge. You can get a certificate and even the University of Helsinki ECTS credits for free.
The course is worth 5-14 credits, and the content is the same as in the Full stack course held at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Helsinki in Spring 2023. There is also an associated project that is worth 1-10 credits."

Part0 focuses on introducing the course material. It has six exercises at the end. Three are just reading exercies while the remaining three involve creating sequence diagram using mermaid syntax.
